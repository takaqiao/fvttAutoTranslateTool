# Changelog

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

All notable changes to StoryFrame will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.11.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **sf2e-anachronism support** — when the [sf2e-anachronism](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/sf2e-anachronism) module is active, two Starfinder 2e skills are added to the PF2e skill panel: **Computers** (Utility category, with Access Infosphere, Decipher Writing, Disable a Device, Hack, Operate Device, Recall Knowledge) and **Piloting** (Physical category, with Drive, Navigate, Recall Knowledge, Run Over, Stop, Stunt, Take Control)

## [1.10.1] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **D&D 5e "Request Roll" button opens StoryFrame dialog** — clicking the chat-bubble icon on a `[[/check]]` or `[[/save]]` inline enricher now opens StoryFrame's Roll Requester Dialog instead of D&D 5e's native handler; implemented via a document-level capture-phase listener registered at module ready, mirroring the existing PF2e Ctrl+click pattern
- **Journal check highlighting works for D&D 5e** — `IntersectionObserver` and manual visibility fallback now detect both PF2e `a.inline-check` and D&D 5e `span.roll-link-group` elements; a shared `_getCheckElementInfo` helper normalises skill name and DC from either format
- **Journal save highlighting works for D&D 5e** — `groupChecksBySkill` now looks up save names from `getSaves()` (e.g. `"Dexterity Save"`) rather than falling back to the raw slug (`"Dex"`), so the `in-view` highlight on sidebar save buttons correctly activates when a saving throw is scrolled into view
- **Missing D&D 5e skill icons** — `fa-fist-raised` (Intimidation, renamed in FA 6) corrected to `fa-hand-fist`; `fa-mouth` (Persuasion, non-existent in FA 6 Free) corrected to `fa-comments`
- **Missing i18n keys** — `STORYFRAME.Notifications.Speaker.OpeningSidebarsForPlayers` and `ClosingSidebarsForPlayers` were referenced in code but absent from `en.json`; both keys added to the `Speaker` notification group

## [1.10.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Target Selector for damage rolls** — Ctrl+click (or Cmd+click on Mac) any inline damage roll link (`data-damage-roll`) in a journal entry to open the Target Selector dialog instead of rolling immediately; works on all game systems
- **Target Selector dialog** — shows all player-owned PC tokens on the current scene as portrait cards; left-click to select/deselect targets; click **Roll Damage** to set `game.user.targets` and execute the roll normally
- **Damage formula display** — parses raw FoundryVTT formulas into a structured header: monospace dice expression + coloured damage-type badge(s) in Pascal case (e.g. `{2d6[fire]}` → `2d6` + orange **Fire** badge); covers all dnd5e and PF2e damage types with per-type colours (fire, cold, lightning/electricity, acid, necrotic/negative/void, radiant/positive/vitality, psychic/mental, force, thunder/sonic, slashing, bludgeoning, piercing, poison, bleed, good, evil, chaotic, lawful, spirit)

## [1.9.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Token image as alternate** — dragging an actor whose token image differs from their portrait auto-populates it as a cycling option; actor portrait and token image are always available regardless of cycling state
- **Alternate images per speaker** — GM can add custom images to any speaker via a file picker (`+` button in the image nav); cycle with `<`/`>` arrows; remove custom images with the trash button (only available for custom images, not built-in actor/token images)
- **Hide speaker from players** — new toggle (`fa-user-slash`) in the speaker thumbnail hover controls hides a speaker entirely from the player viewer; hidden speakers appear blurred in the GM sidebar; GM always sees all speakers
- **Active speaker spotlight** — when a speaker is set active, a dedicated spotlight panel appears on the left side of the player viewer showing their portrait large; the active speaker is removed from the gallery to avoid duplication
- **Spotlight setting** — new client setting "Active Speaker Spotlight" (default on) to toggle the spotlight panel
- **"Now Speaking" label** — spotlight panel shows an "NOW SPEAKING" eyebrow label and the speaker's name below their portrait

### Changed

- **Player viewer layout** — spotlight occupies ~50% of the width (min 180px, max 380px) as a fixed left column; the speaker gallery fills the remaining 50% and scales with the window
- **Image nav controls** — add/remove/cycle image buttons are grouped in a centered row at the bottom of each GM sidebar thumbnail, always visible on hover; `+` opens file picker, `🗑` removes the current custom image, `<`/`>` cycle through all images
- **Speaker action buttons** — all five action buttons (hide-from-players, hide-name, edit, remove, add-image) are now in a single centered flex row above the thumbnail, preventing overflow on narrow thumbnails

## [1.8.4] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Challenge option rolls use selected token** — when a player clicks a challenge skill option, the roll now uses the selected token's actor if it belongs to the valid actor pool (party members in PF2e, owned characters otherwise); falls back to the first valid pool member, then any owned character

### Fixed

- **Challenge builder secret button renders black area** — `position: relative` added to `.secret-checkbox` in both skill and save rows to properly contain the hidden `position: absolute` checkbox input; `will-change: box-shadow` added to the animated checked label to give it its own GPU compositing layer and prevent the Chromium/Electron rendering bug where an `overflow-y: auto` scroll container paints black below an animated element
- **Challenge builder skill and save secret buttons now match** — save row secret button active highlight updated to match the cyan style used by the skill row

## [1.8.3] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed

- **Inline `@Check` wrongly secret** — PF2e compendium auto-detection was firing even for checks without `secret` in their traits, marking Recall Knowledge rolls as secret against the author's intent; auto-detection now only runs when no explicit `isSecretOverride` is passed; inline check callers pass the traits-derived boolean explicitly
- **`bringToTop` crash on unrendered dialog** — when a second `subscribe()` call arrived while the first dialog was still rendering, `addChecks` called `bringToTop` before `this.element` was available; both call sites now guard with `if (this.element)`

## [1.8.2] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Proficiency badges on challenge library cards** — each skill pill in the GM sidebar library and standalone challenge library now shows a colour-coded proficiency requirement badge when `minProficiency > 0`: blue=Trained (T), green=Expert (E), purple=Master (M), gold=Legendary (L)

### Fixed

- **Challenge update not syncing to players** — `_handleStateUpdate` replaced `stateManager.state` with a new object but left all domain managers (`challengeManager`, etc.) pointing at the stale reference; added `StateManager.syncState()` which updates all managers atomically and switched the socket handler to use it
- **Challenge directory showing "Option 1/2/3"** — renaming an option in the builder then removing another option reset all names back to "Option N"; the renumber step on remove now only removes the card and leaves custom names untouched; new option inputs use placeholder instead of value so blank names are no longer pre-filled with "Option N"
- **Challenge update matched by `templateId`** — the edit+save flow now identifies the live active challenge via `templateId` (stamped when presenting from library) instead of fragile name-matching; name fallback retained for older data

## [1.8.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Roll Requester singleton** — only one Roll Requester dialog can be open at a time; Cmd+clicking a second inline check or clicking a skill button while the dialog is already open adds the check to it instead of opening a second dialog
- **Check stacking via subscribe pattern** — all entry points (inline checks, journal skills, sidebar skill/save/action/variant buttons, batch send, challenge requests) now share the same singleton dialog via `RollRequestDialog.subscribe()`; every caller awaits the shared result and sends its own check independently
- **Deduplication** — re-clicking the same check (same skill, action, variant, DC, secret) while the dialog is open silently drops the duplicate
- **Shared `batchGroupId`** — the dialog generates one group ID on submit so all concurrent subscribers honour "Allow Only One" as a unified group
- **Journal Lore section** — lore skills extracted from journal content appear in a dedicated "Journal Lore" section below Journal Skills, with "-lore" suffix stripped from button labels for compact display
- **Roll Requester resizes with window** — participant grid fills available height when the window is dragged taller; whole content area scrolls when checks overflow

### Changed

- **Inline `@Check` action & label now forwarded** — `action:xxx` embedded in the PF2e `data-pf2-traits` attribute and the `name:` label (`data-pf2-label`) are extracted at click time; the action slug is passed through to `requestSkillCheck` so the player executes the correct action (e.g. Sense Motive instead of plain Perception); the Roll Requester dialog displays the label as the action name
- **Roll Requester add-checks is flicker-free** — new checks are injected directly into the DOM without re-rendering; window grows by the exact overflow pixel amount instead of resetting to `height: auto`

## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Action/variant batch highlighting** - Action menu items and variant popup items show gold highlight when batched; re-opening popup pre-marks already-batched items
- **Roll Requester send button disabled** when no participant selected; enables on first selection
- **Ctrl/Cmd+click intercepts any chat post** - Holding Ctrl/Cmd while clicking any "post to chat" button opens Roll Requester instead of posting directly

- **Batch skill actions & variants** - Shift+click actions in the skill actions menu or variants in the variant popup to add them to the batch queue
- **Per-check DC capture** - Each item shift-clicked into a batch captures the current DC and secret toggle at that moment; different checks in the same batch can now have different DCs

### Changed

- **All skills shown by default** - Removed "configure quick skills" button; all system skills now always visible in the PCs tab skill grid
- **Allow Only One moved to Roll Requester** - Removed the toggle from the sidebar controls bar; use the checkbox in the Roll Requester dialog instead
- **Per-check secret capture** - Secret toggle state captured at shift-click time per batch item; dialog also shows correct per-check secret badge
- **Journal skill shift-click toggle** - Shift-clicking a journal skill button when all its checks are already batched now removes them (full toggle)

- **PCs tab simplified** - Removed participant selection; skill/save buttons now open Roll Requester directly with all player-owned PCs (or PF2e party members), no pre-selection needed
- **DC preset popup** - Now renders as a body-level fixed popup, no longer clipped by the journal window
- **PF2e party members in Roll Requester** - Roll Requester uses PF2e party actor members when a party exists, falls back to all player-owned characters
- **PF2e inline check Cmd+Click** - Cmd/Ctrl+click on an inline check repost button opens Roll Requester without posting to chat
- **Challenge option names** - Player sidebar now shows option names above skill buttons

## [1.7.6] - 2026-02-15

  - Added action name mapping from slugs to display names (e.g., "create-a-diversion" → "Create a Diversion")
